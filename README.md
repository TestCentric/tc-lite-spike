# tc-lite-spike
Preliminary work testing ideas for tc-lite

This repository started as a copy of NUnitLite 1.0, which was released in 2013. There was
never a successor to version 1.0 because NUnitLite was incorporated into the larger NUnit
project.

The TC-Lite (TestCentric Lite) project is intended as a continuation of the ideas in the
original NUnitLite. This repository is a spike, that is, it is code that is not intended
to be used but only for trying out some ideas.

The actual development of TC-Lite will take place in the tc-lite repository and be developed
more carefully using TDD techniques. Eventually, this repo will be removed but is being kept
for the time being as a point of comparison.

See the tclite repository for more details.
